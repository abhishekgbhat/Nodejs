This is the first project in the â€œBuild your first Node.js website Node.js" 
article.  http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-simplenode1-app/index.html

This project is designed to bring up your first node.js application.  
This is "Hello node" extended with a user count variable.  
The code is implemented with a server handler, making the transition to Express next easier.

Two CoderDojo style step by step worksheets to first deploy the application and then edit it are in the worksheets directory.  
The step by step directions include edits to the text and adding a new variable. 
There is also a worksheet with step by step directions for obtaining Bluemix and DevOps Services IDs.  
 
The solutions directory contains the code after the article or worksheets are followed.  

The next two projects in the series are
   NodeJS_Simple_2 which adds Express, HTML, and variable passing
   NodeJS_Simple_3 which adds Redis database to store the counters.

The project is designed for direct deployment to Bluemix.
